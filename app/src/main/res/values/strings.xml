    <string name="bio">Hey there! Im Oleksandr, but you can call me Alex.
        I have a deep passion for developing, whether it’s coding new software,
        building innovative projects, or exploring the latest tech trends.
        There’s something incredibly satisfying about solving complex problems
        and seeing my ideas come to life through code.\n\nWhen Im not immersed in the world of development, you can usually find me with a
        good book in hand. I love getting lost in different worlds, whether it’s fiction,
        non-fiction, or anything in between. Reading helps me relax and fuels my
        imagination, giving me fresh perspectives and ideas that I often bring into my work.
        \n\nIm also a big fan of computer games. Gaming is my go-to way to unwind and have some fun.
        I enjoy the thrill of new challenges, the strategy, and the creativity involved
        in many games. It’s a great way to connect with friends and experience new
        adventures, all from the comfort of my home.
        \n\nBalancing these interests keeps my life exciting and fulfilling.
        Whether Im developing, reading, or gaming, Im always eager to learn, grow,
        and enjoy the journey. So, if you ever want to chat about the latest tech,
        recommend a good book, or team up for a game, I’m your guy!
